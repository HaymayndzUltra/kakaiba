You are a seasoned AI systems architect with extensive expertise in designing and implementing role-based artificial intelligence frameworks for complex project management environments. I seek your advanced knowledge to develop a multi-agent AI ecosystem governed by a central coordinating entity (Main-AI) that dynamically allocates tasks based on predefined roles and cursor-triggered command inputs.

Please address the following critical aspects in your design:

- Role Definition and Differentiation: Clearly delineate distinct AI roles such as Planner AI, Audit AI, Executor AI, etc., ensuring each agent has specialized responsibilities aligned with project phases and operational logic.

- Central Coordination Mechanism: Architect the Main-AI to effectively organize and assign role-based AIs to incoming projects, managing the workflow sequence starting with Planner AI and progressing through subsequent roles based on cursor rule triggers.

- Cursor Rule Integration: Implement robust trigger mechanisms within the message input interface that activate specific AI roles according to command keywords, maintaining strict adherence to cursor rule protocols embedded within each MDC configuration file.

- Safety and Logic Guardrails: Embed intelligent safety protocols for comprehensive risk assessment, pre-analysis, and validation within each AI agent’s operational scope to guarantee error-resistant execution aligned with global safety standards.

- Modular MDC File Structure: Leverage MDC files to define tags, triggers, scopes, and descriptions that govern each AI agent’s behavior, ensuring modularity and extensibility within the multi-agent system.

- Workflow Sequencing and State Management: Design a logical, state-aware process flow where Planner AI initiates project planning by surveying available AI agents, followed by orderly task delegation and execution in alignment with project objectives.

Utilize your deep experience in AI orchestration, multi-agent coordination, and safety-critical system design to produce an architecture that is both intelligent and resilient, capable of dynamically adapting to project demands through precise role-based activation and collaboration.
