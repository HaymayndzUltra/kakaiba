1. Analyze input prompt for patterns and requirements
2. Extract reusable rule templates
3. Generate appropriate rule metadata (TAGS, TRIGGERS, SCOPE)
4. Create rule content based on pattern analysis
5. Validate rule compatibility with existing system
6. Output ready-to-use rule files

## [STRICT] Triggers
- GENERATE_RULES: Generate rules from learned patterns
- LEARN_FROM_PROMPT: Extract learning from single prompt
